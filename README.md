ðŸ§® Practice mini Calculator ðŸš€ python 
Title: ðŸ§® Practice Calculator ðŸš€

Description:
The Practice Calculator is a simple Python program hosted on GitHub that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations. It prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operator (+, -, *) to perform the desired calculation. The program then displays the result of the operation.

Features:
- User-friendly interface: The program uses a simple command-line interface to interact with the user.
- Input validation: The program utilizes the `float` function to convert user input into floating-point numbers, ensuring compatibility with different number types.
- Error handling: If the user enters an invalid operator, the program displays an appropriate error message.
- Basic arithmetic operations: The program supports addition (+), subtraction (-), and multiplication (*) operations. To add more operations, you can extend the program using similar logic.

Usage:
1. Run the program: Execute the Python script in a Python interpreter or IDE.
2. Enter the first number: Input the first number when prompted, ensuring there are no leading or trailing spaces.
3. Enter the second number: Input the second number following the same guidelines.
4. Specify the operator: Enter one of the supported operators (+, -, *) to choose the desired arithmetic operation.
5. View the result: The program will display the calculated result based on the selected operator and the provided numbers.

Note:
This calculator is intended for practice purposes and serves as a basic demonstration of Python programming concepts, including user input, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations. It can be used as a starting point for learning and experimenting with more complex calculator implementations. âœ¨ðŸ”¢ðŸ’¡
